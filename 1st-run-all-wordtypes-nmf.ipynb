thomas wolfe gods lonely man travis bickle age   lean hard the consummate loner on the surface he appears goodlooking even handsome he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere lighting up his whole face but behind that smile around his dark eyes in his gaunt cheeks one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear emptiness and loneliness he seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold a country where the inhabitants seldom speak the head moves the expression changes but the eyes remain everfixed unblinking piercing empty space travis is now drifting in and out of the new york city night life a dark shadow among darker shadows not noticed no reason to be noticed travis is one with his surroundings he wears rider jeans cowboy boots a plaid western shirt and a worn beige army jacket with a patch reading king kong company   he has the smell of sex about him sick sex repressed sex lonely sex but sex nonetheless he is a raw

is travis bickle he wears his jeans boots and army jacket he takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette the personnel officer is beat and exhausted he arrives at work exhausted travis is something else again his intense steely gaze is enough to jar even the personnel officer out of his workaday boredom personnel officer os no trouble with the hack bureau travis os no sir personnel officer os got

everywhere welldressed pedestrians are pushing running waving down taxis the highclass theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them the unremitting sounds of honking and shouting play against the dull pitterpatter of rain the glare of yellow red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos when it rains the boss of the city is the taxi driver  so goes the cabbies maxim proven true by this particular nights activity only the taxis seem to rise above the situation they glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic picking up whom they choose going where they please further uptown the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering the rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor junkies still stand around on rainy street corners hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks and the taxis service them too all through the credits the exterior sounds are muted as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner the listener is at a safe but privileged distance after examining various strata of manhattan nightlife camera begins to close in on one particular taxi and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by travis bickle end credits   traviss yellow taxi pulls in foreground on left rear door are lettered the words dependable taxi service we are

briskly across broadway toward the palantine headquarters he s dressed the best we have seen him his pants not jeans are pressed his boots shined his hair combed under his army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie he drops his cigarette steps on it and walks in watching travis enter palantines headquarters we are surprised to realize that travis is really quite attractive his deformities are psychological not physical he believes he is cursed and therefore he is travis walks briskly into the office and heads toward betsys desk tom walks over to greet him but travis ignores him travis at betsys desk i want to volunteer as the camera examines travis face more closely one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet tom at betsys desk if youll come this way travis elbows tom off   travis to betsy no i want to volunteer to you tom under his voice bets betsy waves tom off with a short gesture indicating everything is ok he walks away betsy curious and why is that travis is on his best behavior he smiles slightly travis because you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen betsy is momentarily taken back but pleased travis presence has a definite sexual charge he has those star qualities betsy looks for she senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her and then too there is that disarming smile he is as betsy would say fascinating betsy smiling is that so pause but what do you think of charles palantine travis his mind elsewhere who mam betsy charles palantine the man you want to volunteer to help elect president travis oh i think hes a wonderful man make a great great president betsy you want to canvass travis yes mam   betsy is interviewing travis but she is also teasing him a little leading him on in a gentle feminine way betsy how do you feel about senator palantines stand on welfare this takes travis back a bit he obviously doesnt have the slightest idea what palantines stand on welfare is in fact he doesnt have any idea about politics whatsoever travis thinks a moment then improvises an answer travis welfare mam i think the senators right people should work for a living i do i like to work every day get those old coots off welfare and make em work for a change betsy does a subtle doubletake this isnt exactly palantines position on welfare she remain

place here in my taxi many times a day and i watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones and i say to myself thats a lonely girl she needs a friend and im gonna be her friend

turns and exits tom who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo standoffish actually jealous air steps over to betsy his manner demands some sort of explanation of what betsy was doing betsy simply shrugs its really none of his business and says betsy im just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking   travis is pacing back and forth on broadway just beyond the palantine headquarters he checks his watch travis vo april     four oclock pm i took betsy to the mayfair coffee shop on broadway - coffee shop travis and betsy are sitting in a booth of a small new york coffee shop they both have been served coffee travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands as travis speaks vo waitress brings their orders apple pie for travis fruit compote for betsy travis vo i

mispronunciation than breaks into a big friendly infectious grin the very sight of it makes ones heart proud betsy cannot help but be caught up in travis gin travis contagious quicksilver moods cause betsy laughing travis i never ever met anybody like you before travis i can believe that betsy where do you live travis evasive oh uptown you know some joint it aint much betsy so why did you decide

thats really something travis oh you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab especially when the moons out betsy the moon travis the full moon one night i had three or four weirdoes in a row and i looked up and sure enough there it was  the full moon betsy laughs travis continues   travis oh yeah people will do anything in front of a taxi driver i mean anything people too cheap to rent a hotel room people scoring dope people shooting up people who want to embarrass you a bitterness emerges its like youre not even there not even a person nobody knows you betsy cuts travis bitterness short betsy comon travis its not that bad i take lots of taxis travis i know i could have picked you up betsy huh travis late one night about three at the plaza betsy three in the morning i dont think so i have

polite rationale for her behavior betsy youre right now i remember it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late the next day i was completely bushed it was unbelievable travis if it wasnt for a drunk i would have picked you up he wanted to go to the dmz   betsy the dmz travis south bronx the worst i tried to ditch him but he was already in the cab so i had to take him thats the law otherwise i would have picked you up betsy that would have been quite a coincidence travis youd be surprised how often you see the same people get the same fare people have patterns they do more or less the same things every day i can tell betsy well i dont go to the plaza every night travis i didnt mean you but just ordinary people a guy i know  doughboy  met his wife that way they got to talking she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop taking her home with the flag up betsy thats very romantic some of your fares must be interesting see any stars politicians deliver any babies yet travis well no not really had some famous people in the cab remembering i got this guy who makes lasers not regular lasers not the big kind little lasers pocket sized small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio like a gun you know like a ray gun zap betsy laughs what hours do you work   travis i work a single which means theres no replacement  no second man on the cab six to six sometimes eight seventytwo hours a week betsy amazed you mean you work seventytwo hours a week travis sometimes   or   sometimes i squeeze a few

populate the store he watches the stylish attractive female help unable to come right out and requests what he desires a young salesgirl sees his plight walks over and asks if he needs any help travis inaudibly says a name to her although the name is obviously kris kristofferson the salesgirl digs out kristoffersons silvertongued devil album for him travis says something additional to the salesgirl and she goes off to giftwrap the album travis emerges from the record store the brightly gift wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm   a lengthy pov shot from travis vantage point behind the wheel

off with a start a short first gear  quick shift  a long second gear the cab eases to the right of the street checking out prospective fares our eyes scan the long lines of pedestrians the regular  bums junkies tourists hookers homosexuals hippies  they mean nothing now they only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb  is

and tips travis vo you work at night you get an instinct you can smell them the big tippers the stiffs the trouble makers quarter is good tip for manhattan queens is better brooklyn is best go for the guys with suitcases the rich are the worst tippers hooks are lousy spooks are okay but they dont live at park ave after all the meter is activated   registers tick tick tick a quick glance shows the

admit that he really wants to get this pure white girl into that dark porno theatre travis makes an awkward gesture to escort betsy into the theatre betsy looks at the tickets at the theatre at travis she mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile she thinks to herself what the hell what can happen shes always been curious about these pictures anyway and  like all women no matter how intelligent  shes been raised not to offend her date a perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these inside the theater travis escorts betsy to an empty center row

lap the tv is broadcasting rock time a late afternoon local teenage dance and rock show on screen young teenyboppers are dancing and the tv cameraman as any devotee of the genre knows is relentlessly zoomingin on their firm young breasts fannies and crotches  a sensibility which reflects travis own these supperhour rock dance shows are the most unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has yet developed the hard rock number ends and the tv camera cuts to the local disc jockey a hirsute plasticlooking man about   five scrumptious teenyboppers are literally hanging on his shoulders and arms their faces turned up to him in droolish awe out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey blather he is the complete asshole i dont know who is currently performing this function in new york but in los angeles his name is real don steele tv disc jockey freshingly fantastic freakedout dance time can you dig it dig on it you got it flaunt it travis watches the show

later that night about   travis is on the lower east side somewhere onstreet east of tompkins square the sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once was the hippie movement teenage streetwalkers junkies thugs emaciated loners on the prowl travis taxi pulls over letting out a fare travis pockets his fare but the rear right door doesnt slam  instead there is the sound of another person jumping into the cab travis checks the back seat in the rearview mirror there sits a pale hippie prostitute the girl is at best   or   although she has been made up to look older she wears floppy janis joplin clothes her face is pallid she wears large bluetinted sunglasses and multicolored leg stockings   her name as we shall learn later is iris travis hesitates looking at her in the

lets go this is all a real drag iris lets herself be taken out of the cab the rear door closes sport leans partially in the front window throwing something on the front seat travis looks it is a crumpled   bill sport just forget all about this cabbie its nothing travis cannot see the sports face lime green completely but notices he is wearing a jacket the voice is that of a man in his early

garage travis pulls into his stall travis sits in drivers seat thinking a moment he looks to his right the crumpled   bill still lies there untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously travis reluctantly picks up the   bill and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab he gathers up his time report and heads toward bookin table   a short while later travis is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage his hands are in his jacket pockets obscuring the slight bulge on his left side travis turns into the box offfice of porno theater he reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls out crumpled   bill seeing the   bill he decides not to use it and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead travis walks past concession stand en route to the darkened theater auditorium a young man is now sitting listlessly behind the concessions counter - porno theater auditorium travis slouches down into his seat his face glowing in the reflected light from the screen female movie voice os oh come on now down lick it come on a beat mmm thats good ahh ahh more  travis averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too graphic placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes travis can by turning it inward shut off or open up his field of vision by small degrees movie voice diminishes replaced by sound of travis voice over travis vo the idea had been growing in my brain    tracking shot to wall of travis apartment camera moves slowly across wall covered with clippings notes maps pictures we now see their contents clearly the wall is covered with charles palantine political paraphernalia there are pictures of him newspaper articles leaflets bumper stickers as the camera moves along it discovers a sketch of plaza hotel kennedy airport and cut up sections of city maps with notations written in there is lengthy ny times clipping detailing the increased secret security protection during the primaries a section pertaining to palantine is underlined further along there is a sheet reading traveling schedule and a calendar for june with finely written notations written over the dates   travis vocontd  for some time true force all the kings men cannot put it back together again as the camera reaches the end of its track it finds travis standing his shirt open but the mattress he is wearing the empty holster and the

his back and practices withdrawing it he holds the   firmly at an arms length tightening his forearm muscles he has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm whereby the colt   can rest hidden behind the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated sending the   flying down the gliders into his palm he has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden he straps an army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly he now tries on various combinations of shirts sweater and jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry finally wearing two western shirts a sweater and jacket he manages to obscure the location of all three guns although he resembles a hunter bundled up against the arctic winter he sits at the table dumdumming the   bullets  cutting xs across the bullet heads pov he scans the objects of his room through the scope of the   travis stands in the middle of his apartment staring at his palantine wall his eyes are glazed with introspection he sees nothing but himself

rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio travis walks over to dairy counter in rear of store picks out a pint of chocolate milk goes over to the open cooler and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches he overhears a voice as he looks at the sandwiches when travis returns to the counter with the chocolate milk and a sandwich in one hand he sees a young black man holding a gun on melio the stickup man is nervous hoppedup or both he bounces on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis shoes  a strungout junkie on a desperation ride the stickup man a thorough unprofessional

is already dead melio charged up turns his gun toward travis then realizing the danger is over lowers it again melio thanks man figured id get him on the way out travis sets his   on the counter

is the first time we have actually seen the porno movie itself   several actors and actresses are dallying on screen in whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible whatever the action the movies decor is strictly zodys  ersatz landscape paintings tufted bedspreads as in most porno films the actors look up occasionally toward the camera to receive instructions studio grunts groans and moans of pleasure have been dubbed in action on screen begins to go into slow motion the actors and actresses gradually transforming obscenity into poetry   travis sitting in his chair in his apartment watching afternoon soap opera he is cleaning his   and eating from a jar of applesauce soap opera audio continues he watches the soap opera without expression sound track of film also slows down gradually mixing with and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon tv soap opera a young girl and boy are talking in those familiar soap opera voices and a third party the girls mother who had tried to terminate their relationship   television the boy is visiting the girl in her hospital room both look as if theyve stepped out of the blue chip stamp catalogue soap opera boy is it that she just doesnt  like me soap opera girl hesitantly well jim its just that  i dont know how to say this  its that she thinks your parents arent good enough i guess travis through cleaning his gun begins to play a game with the television set he places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate which supports the tv then slowly rocking his heel back and forth he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without knocking it over   the tv still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama rocks back and forth travis pushes the tv farther and farther until finally the inevitable happens  the crate tips backward sending the portable tv crashing to the floor there is a short flash and the tv screen turns white travis realizing what he has done bends over turns the tv upright on the floor fiddles with the knobs slaps it and tries to reactivate the vanished image travis efforts are futile a tube has broken and the tv will not come back to life travis to himself damn damn travis bends over in the chair and places his head in his hands despairing of himself fade to about   am travis pulls his cab behind a line of empty taxis parked outside the bellmore cafeteria a cabbie hangout on park avenue south he locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis he sidesteps two drunken fighting bums and enters the bellmore a loud buzzer rings as travis steps into the bellmore he pulls a ticket from the dispenser silencing the buzzer and walks toward the walllength counter an assortment of cabbies are seated around a formicatopped table near the rear of the cafeteria some are barely

around his back basketball style another mocks as if hes going to scratch a key along one of the cabs   wizard has no visible reaction a flash of controlled anger crosses travis face he stares at the boy with the poised key it is the same look that crossed his face in the harlem deli we are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just beneath travis surface the black punk must instinctively

about   persons mills about waiting for the rally to begin piped popcountry music plays over the loudspeaker system the cadre of secret service men with their distinctive metallic grey suits sun glasses and football physiques stands out in the crowd on the platform are seated an assortment of local politicos as well as some palantine workers and advisers tom is silently reading something on the podium and betsy stands on the platform steps talking with another worker tom looks up and to his left for a moment then returns to what he was reading then he returns his gaze to the upper left watching something very closely   after a moment he walks over to the steps where betsy is standing tom betsy come over here a moment betsy what is it im busy tom insistent just follow me betsy

standing in the crowd he has shaved his head to a short stubble there he is brush cut wearing a giant grin and a large palantine   button although it is a pleasant sunny day travis wears a bulky bulgedout army jacket travis looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the crowd a short while later travis walks up to a secret service man standing near the fringes of the crowd the secret service man  in sun glasses grey suit everroving eyes  is immediately identifiable   whenever travis confronts a symbol of authority he becomes like a young boy this time is no exception although one suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish exterior the secret service man for his part is about as talkative as the sphinx travis are you a secret service man secret service man indifferently why do you ask travis ive seen a lot of suspicious looking people around here today secret service man glances at travis momentarily secret service man who travis oh lots i dont know where they all are now there used to be one standing over there points secret service mans gaze follows travis finger for a second then return to travis travis contd is it hard to get to be a secret service man secret service man why travis i kinda thought i might make a good one im very observant secret service man oh travis i was in the army too beat and im good with crowds the secret service man is starting to get interested in travis he definitely ranks as a suspicious character   secret service man is that so travis what kind of guns do you guys use   the secret service man decides its

into the crowd   travis sits at his desk in his apartment writing he wears jeans western shirt and empty holster travis vo june   eight rallies in six more days the time is coming   night travis taxi picks up a fare in the midtown area and heads downtown   lower east side travis lets off fare onstreet and cuts across toward tompkins square travis turns the corner when skreetch he suddenly hits the brakes causing the cab to rock back and forth he has almost hit a young girl recklessly crossing the street she thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window cu girls face travis recognizes her face its iris the girl in his taxi a week or so before iris looks at travis sharply then turns and continues walking travis eyes follow her and she rejoins a girlfriend they are both dressed as hippie hookers sloppy clothes boots jeans floppy hats and the old comehither walk is unmistakable travis follows iris and her girlfriend slowly as they walk down the sidewalk travis pov he examines them from bottom to top  boots legs thighs breasts faces hats as travis rolls astride the girls he notices the familiar fringe of a suede jacket standing in the shadows the girls look toward the shadowed figure smile acknowledge some unheard comment and continue on iris looks back uneasily at travis taxi and continues on on the corner stand two welltodo college students somewhat out of place in this environment but making every attempt to groove on it they are high on something or another the girls spot the college students and walk over to them they exchange some small talk and walk off together there is little subtlety involved it is obviously a pickup travis must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the girls and their collegiate johns this is not so easy since the traffic is heavy as travis slows down to make the turn he notices another hippie hooker who had been watching him watching iris and her girlfriend she walks over to the taxi loans in the open left front window and gives travis the comeon disguised as an innocent question cu hippie hooker   hippie hooker hey cabbie you comin or goin travis quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock embarrassment and revulsion he is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar the very presence of this crassly openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him travis takes off with a skreetch his taxi shoots down the block   a hot june day travis taxi the off duty sign on is parked against the curb somewhere in harlem white cops secret service men and reporters punctuate the otherwise black crowds which walk to and fro in the bg charles palantines voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system it is a political rally travis sits behind the wheel coldly staring at something in the distance his hair of course is still clipped short and he wears mirrorreflecting sunglasses even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek travis wears his army jacket with the bulge on the left side  the   smith and wesson bulge a block away palantine stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters on the platform sit an array of black dignitaries nearby we recognize the secret service man travis spoke to at the earlier rally he scans the crowd anxiously palantine is speaking animatedly he is an excellent speaker and captures our attention he drives hard toward his arguments crashes down on his points his strained voice rings with sincerity and anger cu of palantine as he speaks he is dressed in rolledup shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face palantine the time has come to put an end to the things that divide us racism poverty way  and to those persons who seek to divide us never have i seen such a group of high officials from the president to senate leaders to cabinet members     travis no expression palantines words are barely distinguishable from a block away palantine in distance  pit black against white young against old sow anger disunity and suspicion  and all in the name of the good of the country well their game is over applause all their games are over now is the time to stand up against such foolishness propaganda and demagoguery now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor for one man to give in order that all might receive is unity and love of common good such a lost thing all live sound ceases as travis narration begins he is reading from a letter or card he has just written as he speaks we see shots of palantine speaking a seated row of young black palantine red white and blue bedecked cheerleaders secret service agents examining the crowd and so forth these shots have no direct relationship to the narration travis vo reading dear father and mother june is the month i remember which brings not only your wedding anniversary but also fathers day and mothers birthday im sorry i cant remember the

contd her name is betsy but i can tell you no more than that interrupted as travis reads third paragraph a policeman is seen walking from behind travis taxi to his window the policemans voice come during a pause in the narration live sound resumes policeman standing near window hey cabbie you cant park here travis penitent sorry officer policeman you waiting for a fare policeman leans his head in window inspecting the cab as he does travis slides his right hand into the left side of his jacket ready to draw his revolver travis no officer policeman all right move it travis starts up his taxi

reading i hope this card finds you all well as it does me i hope no one has died dont worry about me one day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me love travis travis at his desk examines the card upon which he has just written this letter   cu cover of card it is a  ¢ wedding anniversary card with a fourcolor embossed cover the design could only be described as urkitsch a cartoon mr and mrs allamerica stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast sentiment reads happy anniversary to a couple who have found the perfect combination for marriage the card opens to read love underneath the word love begins travis short message to his parents a message which extends to the back cover of the card   night on the lower east side travis sits parked in the dark shadows of a side street the lone wolf waits travis watches the slum goddesses as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers travis pov some of the young street girls are arrogant almost aggressive others are more insecure and inexperienced a black man charges down the sidewalk across the street from travis he walks at a fast maniacal clip looking only at the sidewalk in front of him out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective thatcocksuckingcrazyno goodassholebitchwhenigetmyfuckingfingersonher niggertitsimgonnaringemandshitupherass and so on he is out of control nobody seems to notice or care travis takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake out finally travis spies the object of his search iris walks down the sidewalk with her girlfriend iris wears her large blue sunglasses travis checks to see if his   is in place it is opens the door and exits from the cab flipping up the collar of his army jacket travis slouches

pulls out the familiar crumpled   bill he makes a big show of stuffing the wrinkled bill into the old mans hand the old man doesnt understand the significance of it travis restrained anger heres the

east side coffee shop it is about   pm iris is dressed more sensibly wearing jeans and a maroon sweater her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out seen this way iris looks no different than any young girl in the big city other patrons of the coffee shop most likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother they are both having an allamerican breakfast ham and eggs large glasses of orange juice coffee   outside here environment iris seems the more pathetic she seems unsure schizy unable to hold a subject for more than thirty seconds her gestures are too broad her voice too mannered we sympathize with travis paternal respect this girl is in trouble iris  and after that sport and i just started hanging out travis where is home iris removes her large bluetinted sunglasses and fishes through her bag for another pair iris i got so many sunglasses i couldnt live without my shades man i must have twelve pair of shades she finds a pinktinted pair and puts them on travis

get away from here the citys a sewer you gotta get out of it mumbling something about her shades again iris fishes through her bag until she comes up with another  ¢ pair of sunglasses and puts them

crotch into her iris smiles she is happy the music rises   firing range  day travis stands at the firing range blasting the   magnum with a rapidfire vengeance   he sets down one gun picks up the next then the next quickly reloading he fires again the targets spin and dance under his barrage the piercing sound of gunshots ring through the air   - apartment travis is again writing at the table his western shirt is open exposing his bare chest a note of despair and doom has entered into travis normally monotone narration voice this will be the last entry in his diary travis vo my whole life has pointed in one direction i see that now there never has been any choice for me   lengthy pov shot from travis taxi we see new yorks nightlife as travis sees it camera tracks down midtown sidewalks in slightly slow motion there we see couples walking in slowing motion young couples middle aged couples old couples hookers and johns girlfriends boyfriends business friends  the whole world matched up in pairs and travis left wandering alone in the night others would notice the breasts the asses the faces but not travis he notices the girls hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriends neck the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder the nuzzling kiss in the ear travis vo contd loneliness has followed me all my life the life of loneliness pursues me wherever i go in bars cars coffee shops theaters stores sidewalks there is no escape i am gods lonely man match  pov another neighborhood later in the night still in slightly slow motion the crowds are more sparse here the streets darker a junkie shudders in a doorway a wino pukes into a trash can a streetwalker meets a prospective client   travis vo continued i am not a fool i will no longer fool myself i will no longer let myself fall apart become a joke and object of ridicule i know there is no longer any hope i cannot continue this hollow empty fight i must sleep what hope is there for me   - apartment travis his shirt fastened stands beside table cu he lays a brief handwritten letter on the table we read it dear iris this money should be enough for your trip by the time you read this i will be dead travis travis stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter folds them up with the letter and puts them into an envelope timecut a short while later travis has cleaned up his apartment everything is neat and orderly camera pans across room the mattress is bare and flattened out the floor is spotless the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight the wall is still covered with palantine political paraphernalia but when we reach the desk we see only four items there an open diary and three loaded revolvers       travis freshly shaved and neatly dressed stands in the middle of his clean room the empty holster hangs on his shoulder metal   gliders can be seen under the slit in his right sleeve he turns toward table   travis envelope in hand closes the door behind him and walks down the corridor he passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is emptyand trashed travis lives in a decaying if not condemned building   - travis places the envelope to iris in his mail box back in apartment camera close on revolvers lying on the table in neat array   fade in sound of a political rally cheering laughing a band playing talking afternoon a crowd of about   persons is assembled before a platform outside a brooklyn union hall a dixieland band is playing on the platform cu charles palantines feet climb out of a limousine there is a roar from the nearby crowd palantine a bulky secret service man to the right and left of him pushes his way through the crowd toward the platform still cameras click and tv cameras purr slight timecut palantine is speaking on the platform   travis empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally at this distance the rally sounds are almost indistinguishable cu of travis boots walking they make their way past one person then two then a cluster of three or four sounds of rally increase we see a full figure shot of travis he is standing alone in an opening near the fringes of the crowd travis looks like the most suspicious human being alive his hair is cropped short he wears mirrorreflecting glasses his face is pallid and drained of color his lips are pursed and drawn tight he looks from side to side one can now see the full effect of travis lack of sleep and sufficient diet  he looks sick and frail even though it is a warm june day travis is bundled up in a shirt sweater and army jacket buttoned from top to bottom under his jacket are several large lumps causing his upper torso to look larger than it should he is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets   anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon travis and think there is an assassin travis pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and swallows a couple   secret service man standing beside the platform scanning the crowd it is the same secret service man travis spoke to at the first rally tom dressed in a conservative suit stands beside him palantine is wrapping up his short speech palantine  and with your help we will go on to victry at the polls tuesday applause travis begins moving up into the crowd palantine contd on to victory in miami beach next month building applause and on to victory next november palantine steps back smiling and receiving the applause then nodding at the secret service man he descends the stairs and prepares to work his way through the crowd travis unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket opening access to his holster with the other hand he checks the   hooked behind his back palantine smiles and shakes a few of the many hands outstretched toward him the secret service man scanning the crowd spots something that interests him he looks closely secret service mans pov travis his face intense pushes his way through the crowd palantine works his way through crowds and cameras secret service man motions to second secret service man and points in travis direction travis slips his hand into his jacket   the second secret service man converges on travis from the side travis and palantine draw closer to each other secret service man walking just behind palantine grabs the candidates hand and pulls him backward palantine looks sharply back at secret service man who motions for him to take a slightly altered route travis sees this his eyes meet the secret service mans he recognizes the situation to his right he spots the second secret service man travis eyes meet palantines candidate and wouldbe assassin exchange quick glances travis hastily works his way back through the crowd he hears the secret service mans voice call out secret service man detain that man overhead shot reveals travis has the jump on his pursuers he is breaking free of the crowd while they are still mired in it travis free of his pursuers quickly makes his way down the sidewalks the secret service men look futilely about travis jumps in his cab sweat covers his face   the film is moving fast now it pushes hard and straight toward its conclusion were moving toward the kill late afternoon travis taxi skids around a corner and speeds into manhattan travis checks his mail slot the letter to iris has already been picked up by the mailman travis stripped to the waist walks back and forth across his - apartment wiping his torso with a bath towel travis begins dressing  he straps the army combat knife to his calf  he reflexes the metal gliders and the colt   on his right forearm   intercut sport stands in his doorway on the lower east side shot with long distance lens it is early evening intercut a pudgy middleaged white private cop walks up to sport the two men laugh slap each other on the back and exchange a soul shake they discuss a little private business and the private cop walks off in the direction of iris apartment  travis straps on holster and fits the   special into it intercut private cop walks down block  travis hooks the huge magnum into the back of his belt he puts on his army jacket and walks out the door intercut private cop turns up darkened stairway to iris apartment night has fallen travis taxi careens down   ave he speeds honks accelerates quickly the glare of speeding yellow and red lights flash through the night travis pov pedestrian attempts to flag down travis taxi but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees travis has no intention of stopping for anything intercut sport maintains his post in the dark doorway he waves to a girl who passes and she waves back travis taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against the curb   travis walks down the block to the doorway where sport stands camera tracks with travis without slowing travis walks up to sport and puts his arm on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness travis hey sport how are things sport shrugs ok cowboy travis needling him how are things in the

sport pushing him even further back against the wall travis get it sport submissive hey mister i dont know whats going on here this dont make any sense travis demanding show it to me sport reluctantly pulls a   caliber pistol a purse gun from his pocket and holds it limply   travis sticks his   into sports gut and discharges it there is a muffled blast followed by a muted scream of pain travis now suck on that agony and shock cross sports face as he slumps to the floor travis turns and walks away before sport even hits as travis walks away sport can be seen struggling in the bg travis he gun slipped into his jacket walks quickly up the sidewalk around the corner travis walks into the darkened stairway leading to iris apartment as he walks up the stairs travis pulls the   magnum from behind his back and transfers the   special to his left hand he walks up the steps a pistol dangling from each hand at the top of the stairs travis spots the old man sitting at the far end of the dark corridor the old man starts to get up when travis discharges the mighty   at him blaam the hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder the old man staggers at the end of the corridor his right hand has been blown off at the forearm there is the sharp sound of a gunshot behind travis his face grimaces in pain a bullet has ripped through the left side of his neck blood flows over his left shoulder travis   flies into the air travis looks down the stairway there sport lies choking in a puddle of his own blood he has struggled long enough to fire one shot falling travis drills another   slug into sports back but sport is already dead travis slumps to his knees down the corridor the old man with a bloody stump is struggling toward him travis turns his   toward the old man the door to no   opens iris scream is heard in the bg the bulky frame of the private cop fills the doorway his blue shirt is open in his hand hangs a   service revolver the private cop raises his gun and shoots travis travis blood gushing from his right shoulder sinks to the floor his   clangs down the stairs   the old man grows closer travis smashes his right arm against the wall miraculously the small colt   glides down his forearm into his palm travis fills the private cops face full of bullet holes the private cop screaming crashes back into the room the old man crashes atop travis the   falls from travis hand both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into iris room iris hides behind the old red velvet sofa her face frozen in fright travis trapped under the heavy old man reaches down with his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right calf just as travis draws back the knife the old man brings his huge left palm crashing down on travis the old mans palm is impaled on the knife old man screams in pain police sirens are heard in bg with great effort travis turns over pinning the old man to the floor the bloody knife blade sticks through his upturned hand travis reaches over with his right hand and picks up the revolver of the new dead private cop travis hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the old mans mouth the old mans voice is full of pain and ghastly fright old man dont kill me dont kill me iris screams in bg travis looks up iris dont kill him travis dont kill him travis fires the revolver blowing the back of the old mans head off the silencing his protests the police sirens screech to a halt sound of police officers running up the stairs   travis struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa his bloodsoaked body blending with the velvet iris retreats in fright against the far wall first uniformed police officer rushes in room drawn gun in hand other policemen can be heard running up the stairs travis looks helplessly up at the officer he forms his bloody hand into a pistol raises it to his forehead and his voice croaking in pain makes the sound of a pistol discharging travis pgghew pgghew out of breath fellow officers join the first policeman they survey the room travis head slumps against the sofa iris is huddled in the corner shaking live sound ceases overhead slow motion tracking shot surveys the damage  from iris shaking against the bloodspattered wall  to travis bloodsoaked body lying on the sofa  to the old man with half a head a bloody stump for one hand and a knife sticking out the other  to police officers staring in amazement  to the private cops bulletridden face trapped near the doorway  to puddles of blood and a lonely   magnum lying on the hallway carpet  down the bloodspecked stairs on which lies a nickle plated   smith and wesson special  to the foot of the stairs where sports body is hunched over a pool of blood and a small   lies near his hand  to crowds huddled around the doorway held back by police officers  past red flashing lights running policemen and parked police cars    to the ongoing nightlife of the lower east side curious but basically unconcerned looking then heading its own way fade to fade in - travis apartment  day it is early fall the trees are losing their leaves   slow tracking shot across - apartment room appears pretty much the same although there is a new portable tv and an inexpensive easy chair visual track begins at table and works across the room to the mattress we see these items  on the table rests the diary closed a desk calendar stands on the table it is october  across the wall where the palantine clippings once hung there are now a series of new newspaper clippings right to left they read   the first is a full back page from the ny daily news headline reads cabbie battles gangsters there are large photos of police standing in iris room after the slaughter and a picture of travis cabbie mug shot   underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo from the ny times twocolumn headline reads cabbie shootout three dead   a followup story from the news twocolumn photo shows plain middleaged couple sitting in middleclass living room twocolumn headline reads parents express shock gratitude   a twocolumn daily news story without photo headline reads taxidriver hero to recover   a onecolumn twoparagraph news story stuck on an obscure page headline reads cabbie returns to job  at the end of the clippings a letter is tacked to the wall it is a simple letter handwritten on plain white paper the handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and orderly we recognize that it is the same letter that is being read in voice over    when we finally arrive at the mattress we find it is barren a pillow and blanket new purchases are folded at the head of the mattress audio throughout the track we hear the voice of a middle aged uneducated man reading in voice over it is the voice of iris father and he is reading a letter he sent to travis and which travis has tacked to his wall iris father vo dear mr bickle i cant say how happy mrs steensma and i were to hear that you are well and recuperating we tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in new york to pick up iris but you were still in a coma there is no way we can repay you for returning our iris to us we thought we had lost her but now our lives are full again needless to say you are something of a hero around this household im sure you want to know about iris she is back in school and working hard the transition has been very hard for her as you can well imagine but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again in conclusion mrs steensma and i would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts unfortunately we cannot afford to come to new york again to thank you in person or we surely would but if you should ever come to pittsburgh you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home our deepest thanks burt and ivy steensma   - plaza hotel  night four cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel   near the entrance travis and wizard stand in the light talking travis hair

stubble there he is brush cut wearing a giant grin and a large palantine   button although it is a pleasant sunny day travis wears a bulky bulgedout army jacket travis looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the crowd a short while later travis walks up to a secret service man standing near the fringes of the crowd the secret service man  in sun glasses grey suit everroving eyes  is immediately identifiable   whenever travis confronts a symbol of authority he becomes like a young boy this time is no exception although one suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish exterior the secret service man for his part is about as talkative as the sphinx travis are you a secret service man secret service man indifferently why do you ask travis ive seen a lot of suspicious looking people around here today secret service man glances at travis momentarily secret service man who travis oh lots i dont know where they all are now there used to be one standing over there

wears jeans western shirt and empty holster travis vo june   eight rallies in six more days the time is coming   night travis taxi picks up a fare in the midtown area and heads downtown   lower east side travis lets off fare onstreet and cuts across toward tompkins square travis turns the corner when skreetch he suddenly hits the brakes causing the cab to rock back and forth he has almost hit a young girl recklessly crossing the street she thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window cu girls face travis recognizes her face its iris the girl in his taxi a week or so before iris looks at travis sharply then turns and continues walking travis eyes follow her and she rejoins a girlfriend they are both dressed as hippie hookers sloppy clothes boots jeans floppy hats and the old comehither walk is unmistakable travis follows iris and her girlfriend slowly as they walk down the sidewalk travis pov he examines them from bottom to top  boots legs thighs breasts faces hats as travis rolls astride the girls he notices the familiar fringe of a suede jacket standing in the shadows the girls look toward the shadowed figure smile acknowledge some unheard comment and continue on iris looks back uneasily at travis taxi and continues on on the corner stand two welltodo college students somewhat out of place in this environment but making every attempt to groove on it they are high on something or another the girls spot the college students and walk over to them they exchange some small talk and walk off together there is little subtlety involved it is obviously a pickup travis must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the girls and their collegiate johns this is not so easy since the traffic is heavy as travis slows down to make the turn he notices another hippie hooker who had been watching him watching iris and her girlfriend she walks over to the taxi loans in the open left front window and gives travis the comeon disguised as an innocent question cu hippie hooker   hippie hooker hey cabbie you comin or goin travis quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock embarrassment and revulsion he is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar the very presence of this crassly openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him travis takes off with a

otherwise black crowds which walk to and fro in the bg charles palantines voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system it is a political rally travis sits behind the wheel coldly staring at something in the distance his hair of course is still clipped short and he wears mirrorreflecting sunglasses even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek travis wears his army jacket with the bulge on the left side  the   smith and wesson bulge a block away palantine stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters on the platform sit an array of black dignitaries nearby we recognize the secret service man travis spoke to at the earlier rally he scans the crowd anxiously palantine is speaking animatedly he is an excellent speaker and captures our attention he drives hard toward his arguments crashes down on his points his strained voice rings with sincerity and anger cu of palantine as he speaks he is dressed in rolledup shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face palantine the time has come to put an end to the things that divide us racism poverty way  and to those persons who seek to divide us never have i seen such a group of high officials from the president to senate leaders to cabinet members     travis no expression palantines words are barely distinguishable from a block away palantine in distance  pit black against white young against old sow anger disunity and suspicion  and all in the name of the good of the country well their game is over applause all their games are over now is the time to stand up against such foolishness propaganda and demagoguery now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor for one man to give in order that all might receive is unity and love of common good such a lost thing all live sound ceases as travis narration begins he is reading from a letter or card he has just written as he speaks we see shots of palantine speaking a seated row of young black palantine red
