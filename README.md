# Movie-Script-NLP-Recommender
NLP and dimensionality reduction performed on 70 movie scripts. Used to identify core themes in each film for the purpose of providing recommendations. This was the 3rd personal project of the Metis Data Science bootcamp.

The main files in this repo include:
1) 2nd-run-verb-adj-nmf.ipynb <br>
This notebook contains the majority of the project. It includes the code for preprocressing the web-scraped movie scripts as well as the topic modeling (non-matrix factorization) pipeline and results. A simple movie recommender based on the cosine similarity of the movie-topic vectors is included along with some visualizations. 

2) Script Viz <br>
Area and radar plots (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) displaying the "amount" of each topic in a given movie. 

3) script-nlp-presentation <br>
These are the project slides that I presented to my peers at Metis.
